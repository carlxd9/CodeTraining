# The Training Page
this is only a repository to store code.

I'm creating a <a href="https://carlxd9.github.io/CodeTraining/" target="_blank">list</a> with some front-end programs to exercise my learnings. 
* Each exercise will be the same program in different languages.
* There will be other back-end languages as well. 


> Feel free to explore, and welcome.
